Python Assignment Programs

This repository contains two Python programs written as part of an assignment. Each program demonstrates the use of functions, user input, loops, and Python’s built-in modules.

# Program 1: Factorial Calculator
Description

This program calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user.

# Features

Prompts the user to enter a number

Uses a function named factorial

Calculates the factorial using a loop

Displays the result in a clear format

Sample Output
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120

File Name
4task1.py

# Program 2: Math Module Operations
Description

This program uses Python’s math module to perform mathematical operations on a number entered by the user.

Calculations Performed

Square root of the number

Natural logarithm (log base e)

Sine of the number (in radians)

Sample Output
Enter a number: 25
Square root of 25.0 is: 5.0
Natural logarithm of 25.0 is: 3.2188758248682006
Sine of 25.0 (in radians) is: -0.13235175009777303

# Requirements

Python 3.14
No external libraries required (uses built-in math module)
